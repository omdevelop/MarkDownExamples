= Upmath: Math Online Editor =

=== ''Create web articles and blog posts with equations and diagrams'' ===

Upmath extremely simplifies this task by using Markdown and LaTeX. It converts the Markdown syntax extended with LaTeX equations support into HTML code you can publish anywhere on the web.

== Markdown ==

Definition from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown Wikipedia]:

<blockquote>Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
</blockquote>
The main idea of Markdown is to use a simple plain text markup. It's <s>hard</s> easy to '''make''' '''bold''' ''or'' ''italic'' text. Simple equations can be formatted with subscripts and superscripts: ''E''~0~=''mc''^2^. I have added the LaTeX support: <math display="inline">E_0=mc^2</math>.

Among Markdown features are:

* images (see above);
* links: [[|service main page]];
* code: <code>untouched equation source is *E*~0~=*mc*^2^</code>;
* unordered lists--when a line starts with <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, or <code>*</code>;
*# sub-lists
*# and ordered lists too;
* direct use <nobr>of HTML</nobr>–for <span style="color: red">anything else</span>. 

Also the editor supports typographic replacements: (c) (r) (tm) (p) +- !!!!!! ???? ,, -- ---

== LaTeX ==

The editor converts LaTeX equations in double-dollars <code>$$</code>: <math display="inline">ax^2+bx+c=0</math>. All equations are rendered as block equations. If you need inline ones, you can add the prefix <code>\inline</code>: <math display="inline">\inline p={1\over q}</math>. But it is a good practice to place big equations on separate lines:

<math display="inline">x_{1,2} = {-b\pm\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a}.</math>

In this case the LaTeX syntax will be highlighted in the source code. You can even add equation numbers (unfortunately there is no automatic numbering and refs support):

<math display="inline">|\vec{A}|=\sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2}.</math>(1)

It is possible to write Cyrillic symbols in <code>\text</code> command: <math display="inline">Q_\text{плавления}>0</math>.

One can use matrices:

<math display="inline">T^{\mu\nu}=\begin{pmatrix}
\varepsilon&0&0&0\\
0&\varepsilon/3&0&0\\
0&0&\varepsilon/3&0\\
0&0&0&\varepsilon/3
\end{pmatrix},</math>

integrals:

<math display="inline">P_\omega={n_\omega\over 2}\hbar\omega\,{1+R\over 1-v^2}\int\limits_{-1}^{1}dx\,(x-v)|x-v|,</math>

== About Upmath ==

It works in browsers, except equations rendered [[/tex.s2cms.com/|on the server]]. The editor stores your text in the browser to prevent the loss of your work in case of software or hardware failures.

I have designed and developed this lightweight editor and the service for converting LaTeX equations into svg-pictures to make publishing math texts on the web easy. I consider client-side rendering, the rival technique implemented in [https://www.mathjax.org/ MathJax], to be too limited and resource-consuming, especially on mobile devices.

Now you can erase this instruction and start writing your own scientific post. If you want to see the instruction again, open the editor in a private tab, in a different browser or download and clear your post and refresh the page.

Have a nice day :)
